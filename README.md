INTRODUCTION

This is my latest android application. I made this application, cause i want to make an application which will help in learning, and 
this application really do that well.
So, you might have a question, what this application do. So, this application provides you the addition question which will generated 
randomly and you have four option to select the correct one from that.

FUTURE PLAN

This application will provide much more types of question not just, the addition one but, games(ex. puzzle, suduko etc)
and some other logic activities.

Definatly, I will apply that later on but, for now just enjoy this new creation. :) :)

Demo for the application, you will find on the screenshots of an application.
so, why you are here just go to it out.

NOTE :- ohh! one more thing, If you want the "APK" file you will get it in APP->RELEASE->APK FILE.
sorry, I forget to put it on outer folder, I will do that later.
